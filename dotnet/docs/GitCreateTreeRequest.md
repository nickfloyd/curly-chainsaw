## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Tree** | [**List<GitCreateTreeRequestTreeInner>**](GitCreateTreeRequestTreeInner.md) | Objects (of &#x60;path&#x60;, &#x60;mode&#x60;, &#x60;type&#x60;, and &#x60;sha&#x60;) specifying a tree structure. | 
**BaseTree** | **string** | The SHA1 of an existing Git tree object which will be used as the base for the new tree. If provided, a new Git tree object will be created from entries in the Git tree object pointed to by &#x60;base_tree&#x60; and entries defined in the &#x60;tree&#x60; parameter. Entries defined in the &#x60;tree&#x60; parameter will overwrite items from &#x60;base_tree&#x60; with the same &#x60;path&#x60;. If you&#39;re creating new changes on a branch, then normally you&#39;d set &#x60;base_tree&#x60; to the SHA1 of the Git tree object of the current latest commit on the branch you&#39;re working on. If not provided, GitHub will create a new Git tree object from only the entries defined in the &#x60;tree&#x60; parameter. If you create a new commit pointing to such a tree, then all files which were a part of the parent commit&#39;s tree and were not defined in the &#x60;tree&#x60; parameter will be listed as deleted by the new commit.  | [optional]
