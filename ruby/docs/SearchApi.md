## search_code

> <SearchCode200Response> search_code(q, opts)

Search code

Searches for query terms inside of a file. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).  When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).  For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:  `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`  This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.  #### Considerations for code search  Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:  *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch. *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'openapi_client'

api_instance = OpenapiClient::SearchApi.new
q = 'q_example' # String | The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as the web interface for GitHub. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#constructing-a-search-query). See \"[Searching code](https://docs.github.com/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code)\" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
opts = {
  sort: 'indexed', # String | Sorts the results of your query. Can only be `indexed`, which indicates how recently a file has been indexed by the GitHub search infrastructure. Default: [best match](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#ranking-search-results)
  order: 'desc', # String | Determines whether the first search result returned is the highest number of matches (`desc`) or lowest number of matches (`asc`). This parameter is ignored unless you provide `sort`.
  per_page: 56, # Integer | The number of results per page (max 100).
  page: 56 # Integer | Page number of the results to fetch.
}

begin
  # Search code
  result = api_instance.search_code(q, opts)
  p result
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling SearchApi->search_code: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the search_code_with_http_info variant

This returns an Array which contains the response data, status code and headers.

## search_issues_and_pull_requests

> <SearchIssuesAndPullRequests200Response> search_issues_and_pull_requests(q, opts)

Search issues and pull requests

Find issues by state and keyword. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).  When searching for issues, you can get text match metadata for the issue **title**, issue **body**, and issue **comment body** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).  For example, if you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.  `q=windows+label:bug+language:python+state:open&sort=created&order=asc`  This query searches for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue that is labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. The results are sorted by creation date in ascending order, which means the oldest issues appear first in the search results.  **Note:** For [user-to-server](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#user-to-server-requests) GitHub App requests, you can't retrieve a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query. Requests that don't include the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` qualifier will receive an HTTP `422 Unprocessable Entity` response. To get results for both issues and pull requests, you must send separate queries for issues and pull requests. For more information about the `is` qualifier, see \"[Searching only issues or pull requests](https://docs.github.com/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests).\"

> <SearchUsers200Response> search_users(q, opts)

Search users

Find users via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).  When searching for users, you can get text match metadata for the issue **login**, public **email**, and **name** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about highlighting search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata). For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).  For example, if you're looking for a list of popular users, you might try this query:  `q=tom+repos:%3E42+followers:%3E1000`  This query searches for users with the name `tom`. The results are restricted to users with more than 42 repositories and over 1,000 followers.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'openapi_client'

api_instance = OpenapiClient::SearchApi.new
q = 'q_example' # String | The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as the web interface for GitHub. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#constructing-a-search-query). See \"[Searching users](https://docs.github.com/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-users)\" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
opts = {
  sort: 'followers', # String | Sorts the results of your query by number of `followers` or `repositories`, or when the person `joined` GitHub. Default: [best match](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#ranking-search-results)
  order: 'desc', # String | Determines whether the first search result returned is the highest number of matches (`desc`) or lowest number of matches (`asc`). This parameter is ignored unless you provide `sort`.
  per_page: 56, # Integer | The number of results per page (max 100).
  page: 56 # Integer | Page number of the results to fetch.
}

begin
  # Search users
  result = api_instance.search_users(q, opts)
  p result
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling SearchApi->search_users: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the search_users_with_http_info variant

This returns an Array which contains the response data, status code and headers.

> <Array(<SearchUsers200Response>, Integer, Hash)> search_users_with_http_info(q, opts)

```ruby
begin
  # Search users
  data, status_code, headers = api_instance.search_users_with_http_info(q, opts)
  p status_code # => 2xx
  p headers # => { ... }
  p data # => <SearchUsers200Response>
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling SearchApi->search_users_with_http_info: #{e}"
end
```
