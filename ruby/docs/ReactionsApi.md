## reactions_create_for_team_discussion_legacy

> <Reaction> reactions_create_for_team_discussion_legacy(team_id, discussion_number, reactions_create_for_team_discussion_in_org_request)

Create reaction for a team discussion (Legacy)

**Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Create reaction for a team discussion`](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/reactions#create-reaction-for-a-team-discussion) endpoint.  Create a reaction to a [team discussion](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/teams#discussions). OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/). A response with an HTTP `200` status means that you already added the reaction type to this team discussion.

### Examples

```ruby
require 'time'
require 'openapi_client'

api_instance = OpenapiClient::ReactionsApi.new
team_id = 56 # Integer | The unique identifier of the team.
discussion_number = 56 # Integer | The number that identifies the discussion.
reactions_create_for_team_discussion_in_org_request = OpenapiClient::ReactionsCreateForTeamDiscussionInOrgRequest.new({content: '+1'}) # ReactionsCreateForTeamDiscussionInOrgRequest | 

begin
  # Create reaction for a team discussion (Legacy)
  result = api_instance.reactions_create_for_team_discussion_legacy(team_id, discussion_number, reactions_create_for_team_discussion_in_org_request)
  p result
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Error when calling ReactionsApi->reactions_create_for_team_discussion_legacy: #{e}"
end
```

#### Using the reactions_create_for_team_discussion_legacy_with_http_info variant
