  # unit tests for pulls_create
  # Create a pull request
  # Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub&#39;s products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  To open or update a pull request in a public repository, you must have write access to the head or the source branch. For organization-owned repositories, you must be a member of the organization that owns the repository to open or update a pull request.  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See \&quot;[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)\&quot; and \&quot;[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-rate-limits)\&quot; for details.

Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See \&quot;[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)\&quot; and \&quot;[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)\&quot; for details.  Pull request reviews created in the &#x60;PENDING&#x60; state are not submitted and therefore do not include the &#x60;submitted_at&#x60; property in the response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the &#x60;event&#x60; parameter blank. For more information about submitting a &#x60;PENDING&#x60; review, see \&quot;[Submit a review for a pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls#submit-a-review-for-a-pull-request).\&quot;  **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the _position_ of that line in the diff. The GitHub REST API v3 offers the &#x60;application/vnd.github.v3.diff&#x60; [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests). To see a pull request diff, add this media type to the &#x60;Accept&#x60; header of a call to the [single pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) endpoint.  The &#x60;position&#x60; value equals the number of lines down from the first \&quot;@@\&quot; hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the \&quot;@@\&quot; line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

  # unit tests for pulls_create_review_comment
  # Create a review comment for a pull request
  #  Creates a review comment in the pull request diff. To add a regular comment to a pull request timeline, see \&quot;[Create an issue comment](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment).\&quot; We recommend creating a review comment using &#x60;line&#x60;, &#x60;side&#x60;, and optionally &#x60;start_line&#x60; and &#x60;start_side&#x60; if your comment applies to more than one line in the pull request diff.

  # unit tests for pulls_get
  # Get a pull request
  # Draft pull requests are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, GitHub Pro, and legacy per-repository billing plans, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub&#39;s products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  Lists details of a pull request by providing its number.  When you get, [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls/#create-a-pull-request), or [edit](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#update-a-pull-request) a pull request, GitHub creates a merge commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the &#x60;mergeable&#x60; key. For more information, see \&quot;[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\&quot;.  The value of the &#x60;mergeable&#x60; attribute can be &#x60;true&#x60;, &#x60;false&#x60;, or &#x60;null&#x60;. If the value is &#x60;null&#x60;, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-&#x60;null&#x60; value for the &#x60;mergeable&#x60; attribute in the response. If &#x60;mergeable&#x60; is &#x60;true&#x60;, then &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.  The value of the &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:  *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; represents the SHA of the merge commit. *   If merged via a [squash](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch. *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), &#x60;merge_commit_sha&#x60; represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.  Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
