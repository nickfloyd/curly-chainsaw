See \&quot;[Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/)\&quot; for details about authentication. For an example response, see &#39;Response with GitHub plan information&#39; below\&quot;  The &#x60;email&#x60; key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for &#x60;email&#x60;, then it will have a value of &#x60;null&#x60;. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication).  The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly.
