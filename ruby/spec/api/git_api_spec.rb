  # Create a tag object
  # Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git.

If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.  **Signature verification object**  The response will include a &#x60;verification&#x60; object that describes the result of verifying the commit&#39;s signature.

  # Create a tree
  # The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.  If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see \&quot;[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-commit)\&quot; and \&quot;[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#update-a-reference).\&quot;  Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.
