  # unit tests for apps_create_installation_access_token
  # Create an installation access token for an app
  # Creates an installation access token that enables a GitHub App to make authenticated API requests for the app&#39;s installation on an organization or individual account. Installation tokens expire one hour from the time you create them. Using an expired token produces a status code of &#x60;401 - Unauthorized&#x60;, and requires creating a new installation token. By default the installation token has access to all repositories that the installation can access. To restrict the access to specific repositories, you can provide the &#x60;repository_ids&#x60; when creating the token. When you omit &#x60;repository_ids&#x60;, the response does not contain the &#x60;repositories&#x60; key.  You must use a [JWT](https://docs.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app) to access this endpoint.

  # Delete an app authorization
  # OAuth application owners can revoke a grant for their OAuth application and a specific user.

You must also provide a valid OAuth &#x60;access_token&#x60; as an input parameter and the grant for the token&#39;s owner will be deleted. Deleting an OAuth application&#39;s grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated with the application for the user. Once deleted, the application will have no access to the user&#39;s account and will no longer be listed on [the application authorizations settings screen within GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).
